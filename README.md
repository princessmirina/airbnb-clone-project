## **🧰 Tech Stack**

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or a similar framework)

* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

* **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX design


## **🎨 UI/UX Design Planning**

### Objective: Document the planning process for the UI/UX design

## **🧭 Design Goals**

* Create intuitive booking flow

* Maintain visual consistency

* Ensure fast loading times

* Prioritize mobile responsiveness

  ## **⭐ Key Features**
